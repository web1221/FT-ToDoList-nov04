# To Do List

## Created by Angela Weber and Lara Bjork on November 4, 2019

### Project Description
This project was completed as part of the Epidocus in-class curriculum. The task description was as follows:

As stated in the prompt from Epicodus, the project objectives are to:

Make a to do list page where people can add tasks to create a list of things to do.

* Add an option for users to indicate a task is done.

* Use jQuery to remove the task from the list.

* Make sure to identify specific behaviors your program should demonstrate, and create specifications with example input and output. List these in the project's README.

We developed the following project specifications:
Spec: The program will gather user's tasks and put them in a list.
* Input: Buy groceries, do laundry
* Output: 1. Buy groceries 2. Do laundry

Spec: The program will allow user to check off items that are completed.
* Input: Click on checkbox in front of item that is completed.
* Output: Item is highlighted in some way (like strikethrough all text).

(The program does not address the assignment's objective of crossing off completed tasks.)
